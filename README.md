# Attitude Change on ChangeMyView (CMV)

This is a code repository for the [Computation, Cognition, and Development Lab](https://www.cognitionasu.org/) at ASU. In this project, we are interested in studying how people's minds are changed on the popular Reddit forum [_Change My View_](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/), which is a subreddit where users post their stance on issues with the understanding that others will attempt to change their view by providing arguments opposing their perspective.  As to be expected, some arguments are more convincing than others. And this project seeks to study the mechanisms that makes certain arguments more succesfull than others, and ultimately uncover the factors that drive belief change on the forum.
