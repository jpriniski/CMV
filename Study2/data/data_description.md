## Description of this directory.

Reddit Change My View discussion data is divided into two folders:
- Study2/data (this folder)
- Study2/data/coded

The data as it is returned by the Reddit API (by running collect_posts.py) is saved in Study2/data.
Once that data's topic classification, evidence use, and detla awards are determined, it will be saved in Study2/data/coded.
