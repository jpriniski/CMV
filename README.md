# Changing Minds on Reddit: Belief Revision on ChangeMyView (CMV)

Code repo for the [Computation, Cognition, and Development Lab](https://www.cognitionasu.org/) at ASU. 

[_Change My View_](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/)  is a popular Reddit forum where users post their stance on issues with the understanding that others will attempt to change their view by providing arguments opposing their perspective; as to be expected, some arguments are more convincing than others. This project seeks to study the mechanisms that drive belief change on the forum, and this is its code.
